# UUID Tool

The unique id (UUID) is saved in an EEPROM on the shield. The
shield is what is plugged into the Radar Baseboard MCU7 and which
contains the actual radar sensor.

Such that the Radar Fusion GUI detects the board the UUID must be
correctly initialized. You can use the uuid tool to do that.

You can read the EEPROM using:
    $ uuid_tool.exe -r

You can write a random UUID to the EEPROM using:
    $ uuid_tool.exe -g

For more options see the usage:
    $ uuid_tool.exe --help
